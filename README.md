# owntracks-http-endpoint
I want to create a little python application that can be used as a http endpoint for [owntracks](https://owntracks.org/).

These are the planned features:
- [ ] save last endpoint and deliver them to predefinded "friends"
- [ ] authentification
- [ ] create location history based on the user settings
